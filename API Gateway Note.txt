Notes for API Gateway:

hierarchy of API:
/
	/query (DELETE,POST,PUT)
		/upload-image(POST)


For all API method, untick "Use Lambda Proxy integration", in the "Mapping Template", tick "When there are no templates defined (recommended)",
set content type as "application/json" and set the following template:
	#set($allParams = $input.params())
	{"body-json" : $input.json('$'),
	"http-method" : "$context.httpMethod"}


To get the code works, the request body should use "url" and "tags" as name, as shown in below, 
because the code in lambda has been coded to accept these parameters

{
    "tags": ["person","laptop"]
}

{
    "url":"the url string",
    "tags": ["person","laptop"]
}

{
    "url":"the url string"
}


The permissions for the lambda function has been uploaded, named folder "lambda permission".
The upload image resources use lambda function "upload-query",
where the other resources use the lambda function "query"
